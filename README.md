# CSE1142_HW4
i have done this homework in CSE1142. It is about linkedlist in c language 

In this assignment, you will build a linked list data structure for storing and organizing a student list that can be iterated in name-alphabetical order (sorted based on the names of the students), in surname-alphabetical order (sorted based on the surnames of the students), and in numeric order (sorted based on the student IDs). The students with their names, surnames, and IDs will be read from an input file (i.e., “students.txt”) and they will be organized by using a singly linked list data structure in the program.
